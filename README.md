## Reflection on the Assignment

### Challenges and Experience
- **Responsive Design:** One significant challenge I faced was navigating the intricacies of Git. From resolving merge conflicts to ensuring the correct branching strategy, the use of version control was a learning experience in itself. Also ensuring that the website looked good and functioned properly on various screen sizes is pretty challenge. I had to learn about responsive design techniques and media queries to achieve this.
- **HTML & CSS Experience:** Working with HTML and CSS was both rewarding and occasionally frustrating. While I loved the ability to shape and style my website exactly as envisioned, there were moments when achieving a specific design aspect took longer than expected.
- **Time Spent:** The overall assignment took me about 6 hours to complete.

### Mobile-friendly Decisions
- **Media Queries:** To make my site mobile-friendly, I implemented media queries that adjusted the layout and font sizes based on the screen width. The navigation bar, for instance, transitions from a horizontal to a vertical orientation on smaller screens for better usability.
- **Scalable Elements:** I also ensured that images and other elements scaled appropriately, and that padding and margins were adjusted to provide a smooth browsing experience on mobile devices.

### Design Considerations
- **Visual Aesthetics:** In designing my website, I wanted a clean and modern look that emphasized usability. I chose a color palette that was both eye-catching and soothing, hoping it would encourage visitors to spend more time exploring my content.
- **Navigation:** I'm particularly proud of the navigation bar and its dynamic behavior based on the user's position on the page. It enhances the user experience by providing clear context and easy navigation.

### Future Improvements
- **Portfolio Section:** Given more time, I'd love to add an interactive portfolio section where users can filter projects based on tags or categories.
- **Theme Toggle:** Another feature I'm considering is a light/dark mode toggle, allowing users to switch between themes for a more personalized browsing experience.

### Time Investment
- I spent approximately 6 hours on this assignment. While some tasks were straightforward, others, especially the responsive design aspects, required a significant amount of research and trial and error.

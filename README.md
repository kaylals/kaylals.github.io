## Reflection on the Assignment

### Challenges and Experience
I expressed concerns regarding the appearance and behavior of my website on different screen sizes. Ensuring a website is mobile-responsive can be challenging due to the variety of devices and screen resolutions.Also, I had multiple questions and issues related to pushing changes, merging repositories, dealing with divergent branches. Git can be quite challenging, especially when it comes to managing repositories, branches, and merging changes. Working with HTML and CSS was both rewarding and occasionally frustrating. While I loved the ability to shape and style my website exactly as envisioned, there were moments when achieving a specific design aspect took longer than expected.The overall assignment took me about 6 hours to complete.

### Mobile-friendly Decisions
To make my site mobile-friendly, I implemented media queries that adjusted the layout and font sizes based on the screen width. The navigation bar, for instance, transitions from a horizontal to a vertical orientation on smaller screens for better usability.I also ensured that images and other elements scaled appropriately, and that padding and margins were adjusted to provide a smooth browsing experience on mobile devices.

### Design Considerations
In designing my website, I wanted a clean and modern look that emphasized usability. I chose a color palette that was both eye-catching and soothing, hoping it would encourage visitors to spend more time exploring my content. I'm particularly like the navigation bar and its dynamic behavior based on the user's position on the page. It enhances the user experience by providing clear context and easy navigation.

### Future Improvements
Given more time, I'd love to add a blog section where I can regularly share my insights, experiences, or tutorials. To achieve this, I may need to learn how to involve saving and managing data in a database for dynamic content management.Furthermore, I plan to enhance user engagement by implementing features like user comments and interactions on my blog posts, fostering a sense of community and discussion.

### Time Investment
I spent approximately 6 hours on this assignment. While some tasks were straightforward, others, especially the responsive design aspects, required a significant amount of research and trial and error.

## Acknowledgements
